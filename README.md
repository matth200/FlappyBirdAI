<h1>FlappyBirdIA</h1>

<h3>Presentation</h3>

It's flappybird game but I add some genetic algorithm with machine learning to make a clever bird which can travel the world of flappybird by itself.

<h3>How it works</h3>

It starts with several birds with "brain", the brain is just a neural network with random biases and weights.
It will score each brain's bird and make mutation and reproduction to create baby bird which are maybe more clever.
It makes that every generation, it's called genetic algorithm.

<h3>Installation</h3>

You just have to run<br/>

<code> ~$ make </code><br/>
<code> ~$ cd bin && ./app</code><br/>



Have funnn !
